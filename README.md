# Usage
Create a new environment and clone the repo

## Install dependencies
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

## Run the app
``` streamlit run app.py ```



The app should start and automatically open in your default web browser, typically at ```http://localhost:8501```

Once the app is running, you'll need to enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar to use the LLM analysis features.
